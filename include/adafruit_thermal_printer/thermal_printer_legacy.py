`adafruit_thermal_printer.thermal_printer_legacy.ThermalPrinter`
=================================================================

Thermal printer control module built to work with small serial thermal
receipt printers.  Note that these printers have many different firmware
versions and care must be taken to select the appropriate module inside this
package for your firmware printer:

* thermal_printer_2168 = Printers with firmware version 2.168+.
* thermal_printer = The latest printers with firmware version 2.68 up to 2.168
* thermal_printer_264 = Printers with firmware version 2.64 up to 2.68.
* thermal_printer_legacy = Printers with firmware version before 2.64.

`adafruit_thermal_printer.thermal_printer` - Thermal Printer Driver
=====================================================================

Thermal printer control module built to work with small serial thermal
receipt printers.  Note that these printers have many different firmware
versions and care must be taken to select the appropriate module inside this
package for your firmware printer:

* thermal_printer = The latest printers with firmware version 2.68+
* thermal_printer_264 = Printers with firmware version 2.64 up to 2.68.
* thermal_printer_legacy = Printers with firmware version before 2.64.

* Author(s): Tony DiCola

Implementation Notes
--------------------

**Hardware:**

* Mini `Thermal Receipt Printer
  <https://www.adafruit.com/product/597>`_ (Product ID: 597)

**Software and Dependencies:**

* Adafruit CircuitPython firmware for the ESP8622 and M0-based boards:
  https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases

# Thermal printer class for printers with firmware version 2.68 and higher.

# classes override specific functions which have different requirements of
# behavior between different versions of printer firmware.  Firmware printers
# vary _greatly_ in their command set--there is not a clean abstraction.  The
# assumption here is that this class is the master with logic for the most
# recent (2.68+) firmware printers.  Older firmware versions inherit and
# override behavior where necessary.  It is highly, HIGHLY recommended you
# carefully study the Arduino thermal printer library code and fully
# understand all the firmware differences (notice where the library changes
# behavior with the firmware version define):
# https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Thermal-Printer-Library
# Bottom line: don't touch this code without understanding the big picture or
# else it will be very easy to break or introduce subtle incompatibilities with
# older firmware printers.
